# MultiMake - Makefile, but better.

MultiMake is a modern, cross-platform build system that is designed to be easy to use and easy to integrate into your project. It is designed to be a replacement for Makefiles, but with a much more modern syntax and a lot more features.

## Features

- Variables
- Functions
- Conditionals

## Installation

MultiMake is written in C++, therefore requires a C++ compiler. The supplied CMakeLists.txt file will automatically download and build the required dependencies, and then build MultiMake itself.
<br />
For Windows, I recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).
